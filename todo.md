    - [x] "Clothes" consistently detected as two syllables

  - [x] Prevent over-limit blocking on incomplete last words
  - [x] Handle partial word input gracefully (e.g., "CL" â†’ "CLO")

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Polish

### Onboarding
- [ ] - Add a dismissable onboarding prompt for new users. Make it punchy, short, but flashy. Suggest sign in to GitHub for AI analysis and syncing benefits

### Layout & Navigation
- [x] **Content centering** - Improve page layout balance
- [x] **Title management** - Enable backspace to shrink content back to title input
  - [x] Note on this, when selecting all text and hitting backspace, this also triggers title input editing. It should not.
- [x] **Sticky validation state** - After adding debounced validation, the progress bar does not reset post-submission.
- [x] **Search interface** - Create hybrid modal with integrated text input, probably kill the bar.
- [ ] **Settings sadness** - Modifying settings clears any current haiku. It would be nice to save state.
- [ ] **Viewer Modal** - Implement viewer modal for viewing editing actions on grid items
  - [x] Editable tags (removable)
  - [ ] Add additional tags (search, create new)
  - [x] Edit, delete buttons
    - [ ] Edit button in viewer modal doesn't work
  - [x] Add delete button 

### Visual Design
- [x] **Tailwind UI fixes**:
  - [x] Resolve transparency and styling issues
  - [x] Fix blue outlines and spacing problems
  - [x] Correct settings pane corner radius inconsistencies
  - [x] Toast appears over the navbar, blocking text and buttons. Display lower. Increase text contrast.
  - [x] Descenders of some letters are cut off on the lowest line.
- [x] **Settings toggles** - Fix non-functional AI analysis and TTS toggles (ensure business logic)

### TTS
- [x] Highlighting is pretty broken. Might consider removing and having play/pause only.
- [ ] Overlapping playback on multiple presses. Don't know why this is so hard to fix.

### Mobile
- [x] Autocomplete seems to cause counting and validation issues.
- [x] Auto newline not triggering on mobile devices.
- [x] Hide app feature bullets in footer on mobile and tablet.
- [ ] Multi-select not available for mobile
- [x] Responsiveness issues
 - [x] Worst for the grid view modal atm

## ðŸ”„ System Integration

### Data Management
- [ ] **GitHub sync** - Resolve synchronization issues
 - [ ] Sync works more like backup atm. No "unsynced remote" awareness until sync fires.
 - [ ] Periodic sync logic missing.
- [x] **Task status management** - Implement task status change functionality
