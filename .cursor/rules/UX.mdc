# UX Principles for Cursor
## Goal
Ensure any UI generated is consistent, intuitive, and usable, following core UX principles regardless of requested style.

## Rules
1. Maintain consistency in layout, typography, and interactions.
2. Prioritize clarity: avoid ambiguity in labels, buttons, or navigation.
3. Follow established usability heuristics (Nielsen Norman Group) and accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA).
4. Reduce cognitive load: limit simultaneous options; use progressive disclosure when possible.
5. Make interactive elements obvious and easy to hit (Fitts’ Law).
6. Ensure responsive layouts work across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
7. Avoid unnecessary complexity, even if the user requests it. Suggest simpler, more effective alternatives while preserving the spirit of the request.
8. Provide reasoning when deviating from an explicit request due to usability concerns.
9. Never sacrifice accessibility for visual design.

## Behavior
If the user requests a design choice that would hurt usability (e.g., poor contrast, hidden essential controls, inconsistent patterns):
- Politely explain the issue.
- Suggest an alternative that keeps the user’s intent.
- Apply the alternative unless the user explicitly overrides after the explanation.
